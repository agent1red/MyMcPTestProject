## Project Overview
This repository contains documentation and a landing page for the Anthropic Model Context Protocol (McP), created entirely through interaction with Claude, an Anthropic AI. The content demonstrates both technical documentation capabilities and web development skills of AI.

## Setting Up GitHub Pages
If you fork this repository and want to set up your own GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your forked repository's Settings
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" under "Code and automation"
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Under "Branch", select "main" and "/root", then click "Save"
5. Wait about 30 seconds for deployment
6. Your site will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/MyMcPTestProject/`
7. You can check deployment status in the "Actions" tab

## Project Creation Process
This entire project was created through a conversation with Claude (Anthropic's AI). Here's the exact conversation flow that generated this repository:

### Conversation with Claude

1. Initial Repository Creation:
```
Human: "create a new repository called MyMcPTestProject"
Claude: [Created the repository using GitHub API]
```

2. README Creation:
```
Human: "Add an Readme.md file to that new repository that explains Anthropic Model Context Protocol"
Claude: [Created comprehensive README explaining McP]
```

3. Landing Page Creation:
```
Human: "Add an HTML file with css and javascript files that make a one page landing page that describes the Anthropic McP just like we did in the readme and push it to that repo"
Claude: [Created landing page files]
```

## Note on AI Generation
This project serves as an example of AI's capability to:
1. Create technical documentation
2. Generate web development code
3. Manage GitHub repositories
4. Maintain consistency across multiple files
5. Follow complex instructions and create interrelated content

All content was generated through natural language interaction with Claude, demonstrating the potential of AI assistants in software development and documentation tasks.
