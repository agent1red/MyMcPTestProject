# Anthropic Model Context Protocol (McP) Documentation Project

## Official Description
The Model Context Protocol (McP) is an open standard released by Anthropic that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. It provides a universal, standardized way to connect AI systems to data sources, eliminating the need for maintaining separate connectors for each data source.

Key aspects of McP:
- Open-source standard for AI-data integration
- Enables direct connection between AI systems and data sources
- Provides standardized interface for tools and resources
- Simplifies development by eliminating need for custom connectors
- Helps AI models produce better, more relevant responses to queries

## Live Demo

## Setting Up GitHub Pages
If you fork this repository and want to set up your own GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your forked repository's Settings
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" under "Code and automation"
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Under "Branch", select "main" and "/root", then click "Save"
5. Wait about 30 seconds for deployment
6. Your site will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/MyMcPTestProject/`
7. You can check deployment status in the "Actions" tab

## Technical Architecture
- Developers can expose their data through McP servers
- AI applications can be built as McP clients that connect to these servers
- Servers provide context, tools, and prompts to clients
- Enables AI systems to maintain context across various tools and datasets

## Project Creation Process
This entire project was created through a conversation with Claude (Anthropic's AI). Here's the exact conversation flow that generated this repository:

### Conversation with Claude

1. Initial Repository Creation:
```
Human: "create a new repository called MyMcPTestProject"
Claude: [Created the repository using GitHub API]
```

2. README Creation:
```
Human: "Add an Readme.md file to that new repository that explains Anthropic Model Context Protocol"
Claude: [Created comprehensive README explaining McP]
```

3. Landing Page Creation:
```
Human: "Add an HTML file with css and javascript files that make a one page landing page that describes the Anthropic McP just like we did in the readme and push it to that repo"
Claude: [Created landing page files]
```

## Repository Contents

### 1. Documentation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive explanation of the Anthropic Model Context Protocol

### 2. Landing Page
- `index.html`: Main landing page structure
- `styles.css`: Styling for the landing page
- `script.js`: Interactive functionality

## Technical Implementation
All files in this repository were generated by AI through natural language conversation. The landing page features:
- Responsive design
- Modern CSS with Flexbox and Grid
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Interactive elements
- Integration with Font Awesome icons

## Key Features

## Note on AI Generation
This project serves as an example of AI's capability to:
1. Create technical documentation
2. Generate web development code
3. Manage GitHub repositories
4. Maintain consistency across multiple files
5. Follow complex instructions and create interrelated content

All content was generated through natural language interaction with Claude, demonstrating the potential of AI assistants in software development and documentation tasks.

## Screenshot
